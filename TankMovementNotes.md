For the tank-movement, there is a hypothetical velocity right triangle. The angle of the player will constitute the terminal angle. The length of the hypotenuse will determine the velocity. The increase of the length of this triangle will be dictated by player_accel. To apply this in-game The amount that player moves on the X and Y axis per frame is the respective sin and cosine of this triangle.
